Example: Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
    e) Requirements Validation:
Ensure consistency and alignment with stakeholder needs.Validate documented requirements and models.He also Achieve clarity and precision.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent, manageable modules. These modules can be functions, classes, or components.
 
Here’s how it benefits software systems:

    Maintainability:

    Modules have distinct responsibilities, making it easier to locate and fix issues.
    Changes in one module don’t affect others, reducing the risk of unintended side effects.
    You can update specific modules without overhauling the entire system.

    Scalability:
    ability to Add new modules as needed without disrupting existing functionality.
    Teams can work on different modules simultaneously.
    Well-designed modules can be reused across projects, saving time and effort.

Testing in Software Engineering: 

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 

1. Unit Testing:
Purpose: Focuses on individual components (e.g., methods, functions).
Goal: Verify component functionality in isolation.
Benefits: Early bug detection, code quality improvement.
Example: Testing a calculator program’s addition function.

2. Integration Testing:
Purpose: Checks interactions between components.
Goal: Ensure seamless data flow across modules.
Benefits: Detects integration issues, prevents system-wide failures.

3. System Testing:
Purpose: Evaluates entire system functionality.
Goal: Verify functional and non-functional requirements.
Benefits: Ensures system meets stakeholder expectations.

4. Acceptance Testing:
Purpose: Validates software against user criteria.
Goal: Confirm compliance with specifications or contracts.
Benefits: Builds customer trust, enhances user satisfaction.

Importance of Testing:

    Detect Defects: Uncover bugs early for timely fixes.
    Maintain Quality: Regression, usability, and security testing.
    Enhance Product: Address bugs, optimize, align with feedback.
    Customer Trust: Stable, reliable software leads to positive experience

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

    Version control is the practice of managing changes to source code. It involves keeping a detailed account of every modification made to the code, ensuring that these changes are both trackable and reversible. 

    why are they important in software development

        1. Streamlined Release Management:
        Version control helps maintain different software release versions.
        Releases encapsulate enhancements and features aligned with the release roadmap.

        2. Conflict Prevention:
        Separate branches for different releases minimize code conflicts.
        Avoids overlapping changes that could cause conflicts.

        3. Tracking Changes to Digital Artifacts:
        Beyond source code, version control tracks changes to other artifacts (e.g., design specs, requirement documents).
        Ensures consistency across iterations.

        Types of Version Control Systems:
    
            Local Version Control:

            Changes stored locally before being pushed to a single code version.
            Retrieving changes can be challenging if local versions or the single code version become corrupted.

            Central Version Control:
            Hosts different code versions in a centralized repository.
            Users can access and push/pull changes.
            Risk: If the centralized repository becomes corrupted, retrieval is difficult.

            Distributed Version Control:
            Each user has a complete copy of the repository.
            Git, Subversion, and Mercurial are popular examples.
            Git, in particular, is widely used due to its speed, flexibility, and robust features
